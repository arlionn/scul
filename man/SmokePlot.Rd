\arguments{
\item{x.PlaceboPool.StandardizedDiff.full}{A (T by L), where L<=J)  data frame containing all products that are included in the placebo distribution
Default is SCUL.inference$y.placebo.StandardizedDifference.Full}

\item{x.PlaceboPool.CohensD}{A (1 by L)  data frame containing all pre-period Cohen's D fit statistic for each placebo unit.
Default is SCUL.inference$y.placebo.CohensD,}

\item{TreatmentBeginsAt}{An integer indicating which row begins treatment. Default is  SCUL.output$TreatmentBeginsAt.}

\item{OutputFilePath}{Output file path. Default is SCUL.input$OutputFilePath.}

\item{CohensD}{A real number greater than 0, indicating the Cohen's D threshold at which
fit is determined to be "poor". The difference is in standard deviation units. Default is SCUL.input$CohensDThreshold.}

\item{y.actual}{The actual (target) data. Default is SCUL.output$y.actual.}

\item{y.scul}{Synthetic data created by SCUL procedure. Default is SCUL.output$y.scul.}

\item{fig.title}{Title of smoke-plot. Default is "Standardized difference for target variable compared to standardized difference for each placebo"}

\value{
graph  A smoke plot of the standardized effect size compared to placbos.
